# Poker Engine

Main logic for the Poker game.

## poker-lib

The engine's C++ code is in `poker-lib`, most notably, the use of [Heiko Stamer's LibTMCG library].

## Mock JS implementation

A simple Javascript API intended to mimic the expected behavior of the real engine, in order to allow for testing the game's workflow. It can be found in the [mock] directory.
