# Poker Electron App

Desktop version of the [Texas HODL'em Poker](../README.md).
It's basically a port of the [webapp](../webapp/README.md) version to the [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) framework.

It also depends on the `Descartes Environment` being properly set up as defined in the [project documentation](../README.md#Environment).

## Deploying and Running

The process is quite similar to [the one available in the webapp](../webapp/README.md#deploying-and-running) version of the application.

The basic difference is that the application will run from [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and be opened by a Chromium instance under Electron.
Do not use a web browser to navigate the application.

Deployment logs are also accessible at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).
